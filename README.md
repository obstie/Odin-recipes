Introduction

This project is focused on learning and applying Responsive Web Design principles to build a modern, user-friendly web page that looks great and functions smoothly across all devices â€” from mobile phones and tablets to laptops and desktop screens.

By completing this project, I aim to demonstrate my ability to:

Structure a web page using semantic HTML

Style layouts with CSS Flexbox and Grid

Use media queries to adjust designs for different screen sizes

Follow mobile-first design practices

Create web pages that are accessible, scalable, and responsive

Apply a structured development process, including version control (Git) and documentation

This project is not just about building a layout but about understanding why responsive design matters, and how to make websites that adapt beautifully to the ever-changing world of screen sizes and devices.
