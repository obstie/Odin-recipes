    <h2>Baked cheesecake – made easy!</h2>
    <p>This classic baked cheesecake is rich and creamy yet light, sweet without being overly sweet. This is an easy Cheesecake recipe that anyone can make, thanks to a couple of little-but-important tips I’m sharing!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <h4>Biscuit base</h4>

        <li>200g Marie crackers or other plain biscuits</li>
        <li>120g unsalted butter</li>

        <h4>Cake filling</h4>

        <li>500g cream cheese</li>
        <li>2 tbsp corn flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups caster sugar</li>
        <li>Zest of 1 lemon</li>
        <li>3 large eggs </li>

        <h4>Toppings</h4>

        <li>Strawberries, blueberries, raspberries</li>
        <li>Icing sugar / powdered sugar , for dusting</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <h4>Biscuit base</h4>
        <li>Blitz – Break up biscuits roughly by hand and place in a food processor. Blitz until fine crumbs (Note 5). Add butter, briefly blitz until dispersed and it resembles wet sand.</li>

        <li>Press into pan – Pour into the prepared cake tin. Use a spatula to roughly spread it out over the base and up the walls. Use something with a flat base and vertical edges (I used a measuring cup) to press the crumbs up the wall almost to the top of the sides, and flatten the base.</li>
    </ol>    
        
    <ol>
        <h4>Cake filling</h4>

        <li>Beat cream cheese – Use a mixer or beater to beat the cream cheese until smooth – about 30 seconds on medium high,.</li>
        <li>Finish batter – Add flour, beat until just combined (10 sec). Add vanilla, sour cream, sugar and lemon zest. Beat until just combined (10 – 15 sec). Add eggs one at a time, beat in between until just combined (10 sec each). Don't over beat, we don't want to aerate the batter.</li>
        <li>Bake – Pour into prepared crust. Bake for 55 minutes. The top should be a very light golden brown, not cracked, and near perfectly flat. It should jiggle slightly when you gently shake the pan</li>
        <li>Cool in the oven with the door open 20 cm / 8" (Note 6), then refrigerate for 4 hours+ in the pan.</li>
        <li>Remove springform pan sides. Use overhang paper to slide cheesecake off the cake pan. Then slide the cheesecake off the paper.</li>
        <li>Serve – Top with berries and dust with icing sugar!</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Recipe Notes:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Biscuits: Any plain crackers will work fine here, you need 2 cups of crumbs.</li><br>
        <ul>
        <li>Australia: Arnott’s Marie Crackers, Arrowroot and Nice are ideal, I’ve made it with all these.</li>
        <li>US: Use 28 squares / 14 full sheets, yes I measured it with my last Graham Cracker packet I brought back from my last trip.</li>
        <li>UK: Digestives are ideal, I LOVE digestives!</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The crumb should be like wet sand so when pressed, it stays packed firmly, especially up the wall. Adjust if necessary with more butter. It’s delicate when uncooked but once the filling is cooked, it becomes much more stable.</p>

        <li>Cream Cheese – In the UK and some parts of Europe, block cream cheese isn’t available. If you can only get spreadable cream cheese in tubs (softer than block), skip the sour cream.</li><br>
        <li>Lemon Juice or Water – Depends on sweetness of strawberries. If they aren’t that sweet, use water instead.</li><br>
        <li>Inverted cake pan with overhang paper: The base of springform pans have a slight ridge. By inverting it, there is no ridge which makes it easier to slide the cheesecake on a serving platter without ruining the crust. There is no risk of batter leakage as the crust is thick enough to hold it all in.</li><br>
        <li>Crumbs: OR crush in a ziplock bag using a rolling pin or large can.</li><br>
        <li>Cool in oven: This helps stop the surface from cracking.</li><br>
        <li>Different measures: Cups and spoons vary slightly between countries (US and CAN are different to most of the rest of the world). I have made this recipe using both US and Australian measures, using Australia Marie crackers and US Graham Crackers. The Graham Cracker crust is slightly crunchier because the biscuit doesn’t crush to a fine sand like Marie Crackers do. Both are delicious!</li>
    </ol>
